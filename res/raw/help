<p><strong>Why do I need a social networking account?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Blackmail Me uses your social networking account to post a message or photo that you&#39;ve selected if you do not reach your goal.<br />
<br />
<strong>Does that mean you know my password?</strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; No, you sign in using Facebook or Twitter and grant the app permission to post using your account.<br />
<br />
<strong>Will you ever use my account for anything other than posting what I tell you to?</strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; No.<br />
<br />
<strong>How does it know when to check if I&#39;m at a certain location?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Through your GPS. You tell it a range of time when you plan to be there, and it will check if you are there or not with a +-15 minute buffer. If your GPS is off, it assumes you are at your last known location.</p>

<p><strong>What is a &quot;backout&quot;?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;A backout is your breathing room for failure. For instance, if you wanted to go to the gym 10 times, but only went 9 times, 1 backout counter would save you from the Blackail being sent.&nbsp;<br />
<br />
<strong>What if I don&#39;t want to do something every single day?</strong><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Give yourself the appropriate number of backout counters to alleviate this problem. In the future, a smarter checking routine may be added. Remember that consistency plays a large role in achieving long-term goals.<br />
<br />
<strong>Who would do this to themselves?</strong><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; People who are seeking external motivation to help them succeed in some way.</p>

<p><strong>How do I use this app?</strong></p>


<b>1.</b>&nbsp;Set up your account by using Account Setup.<br />
<b>2.</b>&nbsp;Create your goal. This involves picking a location, duration, and time to check.<br />
<b>3.</b>&nbsp;Pick what kind of Blackmail you want. What platform should be used, and do you want a picture to be posted, or a message?<br />
<b>4.</b>&nbsp;Continue on with your life, and revel in the fact that your phone is now willing to show you some tough love.<br />


<p><strong>Help! I used something way too embarassing that I never wanted to be posted!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>Uninstall the app, this will erase everything associated with the Blackmail. Nothing is stored on a remote server, so everything will be erased. This was a design decision that was made especially for situations like this. Next time, pick something less toxic.<br />
